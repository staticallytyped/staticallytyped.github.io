<h3>01.22 On technical interviews</h3>
<div>
  We’re in the midst of hiring a tech lead for our team, and my manager had just gotten off a technical screen with a female candidate where he’d asked her to code a binary search function.
<br><br>
When she saw the question, the candidate declined to proceed with the interview process, citing algorithm based interview questions as discriminatory towards people with families and children (most notably female engineers) who may not have the luxury of spending time outside of work grinding Leetcode problems to prepare for these technical interviews. She was an advocate for diversity and inclusion in the workplace, and felt that companies should make their interview processes more accessible to people outside of the stereotypical early-to-middle-aged, single male demographic.
<br><br>
Ultimately, she felt that the algorithm question was indicative of our company’s adherence to the status quo, and decided we would not be a good fit for her.
<br><br>
During our team meeting that afternoon, we discussed the validity of her feedback and brainstormed how to do better by our candidates.
<br><br>
While I’m not sure I would go as far as to call the questions “discriminatory,” there’s no doubt that the standard technical interview process is flawed, prescriptive, and bears little correlation to how an engineer will perform on the job.
<br><br>
While I was job hunting, I complained incessantly about Leetcode and the memorization and repetition that I was subject to just to land a job and never use those skill sets again. I’ve seen friends struggle through the same process over weeks and months. And here I am now, on the other side of the table, perpetuating the same thing that I hated. Is this industry sanctioned hazing?
<br><br>
It’s easy to see there’s a problem here, easier, still, to shrug it off with a, “well how else can you gauge a candidate’s ability to code?” But my manager is challenging himself and challenging us to do better. How can we mend what’s broken about the technical interview, while upholding the standards for our engineering hires?
<br><br>
A few products of our brainstorm:
<br>
- A product domain specific coding problem. Give the candidate a taste of a bug fix or small feature we’ve had to implement in our code base
<br>
- A take home test. Give the candidate the flexibility and autonomy to implement a project on their own time
<br>
- A pair programming session. Gauge the candidate’s skillset through having them drive and/or navigate
<br>
- Choose your own coding adventure. Let the candidate choose from their preferred interview format.
<br><br>
None of these solutions are absolute, nor do they have to be mutually exclusive. It’s possible the sweet spot lies at the juxtaposition of two or more of these; it’s also possible we’ll experiment with these approaches and default back to the dreaded (but safe and industry standard) algorithmic approach. It’s going to take time and take effort and take care to do this right.
<br><br>
Regardless of how I feel about the candidate’s critique, I wish her luck on her job hunt and I’m grateful that she sparked this debate and opened the door to some change.
