<h3>02.08 Representation matters</h3>
<div>
  I work at a tech startup just shy of a hundred employees.
  <br><br>
  We have twenty-eight engineers. Out of those twenty-eight, four are female or female presenting* (that's 14.3%).
  <br><br>
  The four of us constitute the four most inexperienced engineers <b>at the company</b>,
  while simultaneously being the <i>only</i> female engineers.
  <br><br>
  And while I am fortunate to have never felt discriminated against due to my gender,
  nor been made to feel inferior to male programmers at my company,
  at some point or another in their career, every software engineer finds themselves doubting
  their ability and their self worth.
  <br><br>
  As the most experienced female engineer at the company,
  standing at the precipice of this chasm we euphemized as the "gender gap," it's hard to
  convince myself it's worthwhile to push forward into the unknown,
  to convince myself it'll all pay off someday.
  <br><br>
  On the days when I'm feeling particularly frustrated with an obstinate bug
  or when the imposter syndrome gnaws away at my confidence,
  I find myself wishing I had a female role model to look up to and think,
  <b>"If she could do it, so can I."</b>
  <br><br>
  Representation matters.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  *Gender expression is self reported and I unfortunately don't have complete data
  on gender breakdown and who identifies as male, female, or non binary.
