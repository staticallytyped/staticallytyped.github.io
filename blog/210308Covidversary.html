<h3>03.08 Covid-versary</h3>
<div>
A year ago, I received an email from our CEO asking the entire company to work from home for the next two weeks.
Those two weeks have since become fifty-two weeks (and still, with no end in sight).
<br>
<br>
At the time, schools were still in session, most companies had not yet announced a transition to remote work, and statewide lockdowns were unheard of.
<br>
Whispers of contagion were growing louder, toilet paper was flying off the shelves, but the notion of "pandemic" was still largely regarded as fearmongering.
<br>
<br>
Life would return to normal in two weeks--a month, at most. Then it'll be business as usual.
<br>
<br>
Or so we thought...
<br>
<br>
A lot changed in the year that followed.
<br>
<br>
Over the course of a weekend, I went from never working from home to perpetually working from home.
As it became painfully obvious that normalcy was not on the horizon,
I packed up my work station. Raided the office pantry one last time. Learned how to make my own coffee.
<br>
<br>
I traded my open office desk space for my bedroom/makeshift office space.
I traded conference rooms for Zoom rooms.
And I traded water cooler talk for... nothing
(as a society, we're still trying to find a covid-friendly replacement for socially mandated, awkward, small talk).
<br>
<br>
Colleagues were onboarded and some, subsequently, offboarded without my ever having met them in person.
There was a time when that bothered me, but even that soon lost its novelty.
<br>
I've learned to embrace the freedom and allowances of remote work
while being deliberate about making time for the social aspects of my job
(moving my coffee runs and gossiping to scheduled Zoom meetings)
and being cognizant of the limitations of virtual pair programming ("Can you zoom in on your code, please?" and "I think you're sharing the wrong screen").
<br>
<br>
This, and everything else that's happened in the past year, have been a testament to what we can adapt to when the need arises.
<br>
<br>
Cheers to resilience, to covid vaccines, and to year two of remote work.
